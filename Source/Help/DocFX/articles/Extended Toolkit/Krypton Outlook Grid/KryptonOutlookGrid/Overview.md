# KryptonOutlookGrid - Overview

The `KryptonOutlookGrid` is a component originally developed by JDH Software to extend upon the capabilities of the standard *WinForms DataGridView*.

Based on the work done by Herre Kuijpers, the `KryptonOutlookGrid` is more flexible than a *DataGridView*, allowing for items to be grouped together. Currently, only two data types can be used for data binding: a *DataSet* or an object array list (the list must implement *IList*, for instance, the *ArrayList*). Other types are as of yet not supported, like, for instance, a *DataTable* or a *DataTableView*.
