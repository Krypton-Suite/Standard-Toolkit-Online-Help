# Using Krypton in Visual Studio 2022

The purpose of this article is to guide developers who might be new to Krypton to show how to install the toolkit correctly. Note, that this will just only cover the installation of the `Krypton.Toolkit` package, but the same steps will apply to all our other packages. Krypton is *only* serviced via NuGet. For instructions on how to build the toolkit for yourself, see [How to Build the Krypton Toolkit](How%20to%20Build%20the%20Krypton%20Toolkit.md).
