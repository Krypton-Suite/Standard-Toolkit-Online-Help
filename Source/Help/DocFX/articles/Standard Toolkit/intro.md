# Overview

Before using the *Krypton* suite of components you should read all of the overview section.

[**Structure**](Overview/Structure.md)   

Describes the consistent organization used for each of the controls and components. Once you understand how they are structured it becomes much easier to quickly and easily find the property or event you need to modify. At a minimum you should read this section before using the controls in your own application.

[**Background**](Overview/Background.md)   

Describes the properties used to customize the drawing of the background. Not all controls draw a background and so this set of properties will only be found within the states of those controls that have a background drawing capability.

[**Border**](Overview/Border.md)

Describes the properties used to customize the drawing of the border. Most but not all of the controls have the ability to draw a border and so the set of properties are only found in the states of controls that draw a border.

[**ButtonSpec**](Overview/ButtonSpec.md)

Describes how button specifications can be used to add button functionality to some of the *Krypton* controls.

[**Content**](Overview/Content.md)

Describes the properties used to customize the drawing of control values. Any control that draws values such as text will have a set of content properties within each control state.

[**Palettes**](Overview/Palettes.md)  

Describes how to design and use palettes within your application in order to alter the look and feel quickly.
