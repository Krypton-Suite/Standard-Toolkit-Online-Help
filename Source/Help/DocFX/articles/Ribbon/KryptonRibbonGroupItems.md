# Ribbon Group Items

There are several types of group item that can be placed in the various group containers. Not all item types can be placed in all the container types so read the documentation on the individual item types for a list of the compatible containers.

Adding new item instances at design time is very easy. Just use the element helpers called *New* that are placed inside the group containers. If only a single type of item is allowed that item type will be created and added immediately. If multiple item types are allowed then a context menu will appear presenting all the different options you can choose. To edit an existing item just left click it with the mouse and the *Properties Window* will show the details are editing.

Following are the different types of group items.
