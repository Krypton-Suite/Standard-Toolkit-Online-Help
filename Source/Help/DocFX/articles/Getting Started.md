# Getting Started

Before writing any applications that use *Krypton* you are recommended to read the documentation in order to speed up your development and get the most from the suite of components. To explore some of the capabilities you should run the *Krypton Explorer* application that was placed onto the desktop during installation. You can then explore the various example applications.

As a minimum you should read the [Overview - Structure](Overview/Structure.md) section to get a feel for the common organization of all the controls and components. Then run through the [Tutorials - Three Pane Application](Tutorials/Three%20Pane%20Application.md) tutorial for an example application being built with the controls. Finally read the description of a typical control such as [Toolkit - KryptonButton](Toolkit/KryptonButton.md) to see how specific controls are structured.
