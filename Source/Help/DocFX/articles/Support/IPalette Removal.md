# `IPalette` Removal

As of version 80, the `KryptonManager` and themes has had a major overhaul. This means that your projects will not build, unless you take the following actions, which can be achieved by a 'Find & Replace'.

* `IPalette` now becomes `PaletteBase`
* `PaletteModeManager` now becomes `PaletteMode`
