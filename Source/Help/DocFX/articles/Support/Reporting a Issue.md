# Reporting a issue or making a feature request

While we endeavour to ensure that the tool-kits' are bug free, sometimes it is not possible to test everything. If you see a bug or want to see a feature to be implemented, please use the links below.

Standard Toolkit: [Report it here](https://github.com/Krypton-Suite/Standard-Toolkit/issues/new/choose)

Extended Toolkit: [Report it here](https://github.com/Krypton-Suite/Extended-Toolkit/issues/new/choose)

***Note: Please do not use Discord to report bugs, as they cannot be tracked. The only exception to this rule is if you do not have a GitHub account. In this case, please ping `@Developer` on our Discord server for assistance. Thanks!*** :slightly_smiling_face:
