# Installing Krypton via NuGet

The purpose of this article is to guide developers who might be new to Krypton to show how to install the toolkit correctly. Note, that this _will_ just only cover the installation of the `Krypton.Toolkit` package, but the same steps will apply to **all** our other packages. Krypton is _only_ serviced via NuGet, unless you decide to [build](https://krypton-suite.github.io/Standard-Toolkit-Online-Help/Source/Help/Output/articles/Contributing/How-to-Build.html) the toolkit yourself.

**Step 1:** Open Visual Studio 2022

**Step 2:** Create a new, or open an existing project

**Step 3:** In `Solution Explorer`, right click your project, then click **Manage NuGet Packages**

**Step 4:** In the newly opened tab, click `Browse`, then search for **Krypton**

**Step 5:** Find the package you require, then click **Install** (_Note: You may need to accept some license agreements during this process_)

**Step 6:** Close all tabs, then rebuild your projects
