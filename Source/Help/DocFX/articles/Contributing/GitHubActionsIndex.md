## Quick Navigation

### Workflow Documentation

| Workflow | File | Purpose | Documentation |
|----------|------|---------|---------------|
| **Build** | `build.yml` | CI/CD validation and releases | [Build Workflow](Workflows/BuildWorkflow.md) |
| **Release** | `release.yml` | Multi-channel production releases | [Release Workflow](Workflows/ReleaseWorkflow.md) |
| **Nightly** | `nightly.yml` | Scheduled nightly builds | [Nightly Workflow](Workflows/NightlyWorkflow.md) |

---

## Workflow Summary

### [Build Workflow](Workflows/BuildWorkflow.md)
**File**: `.github/workflows/build.yml`

Primary CI/CD workflow for validating code quality and creating releases.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Validates all pull requests
- ✅ Multi-framework builds (.NET Framework 4.7.2 - 4.8.1, .NET 8 - 10)
- ✅ Automated GitHub releases for master branch
- ✅ NuGet package caching for performance
- ✅ Fork protection

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests to any branch
- Push to protected branches (master, alpha, canary, gold, V85-LTS)

**Jobs**:
1. **build** - Compiles and validates code
2. **release** - Creates GitHub releases (master only)

**Documentation**: [Full Build Workflow Documentation →](Workflows/BuildWorkflow.md)

---

### [Release Workflow](Workflows/ReleaseWorkflow.md)
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

Handles production releases across four different release channels.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Four independent release channels (Master, LTS, Canary, Alpha)
- ✅ Automatic NuGet package publishing
- ✅ GitHub release creation with artifacts (master only)
- ✅ Discord webhook notifications
- ✅ Multi-framework support
- ✅ Intelligent duplicate detection

**Triggers**:
- Push to: master, alpha, canary, V85-LTS

**Release Channels**:

| Channel | Branch | Package Suffix | Tag Format | Discord Color |
|---------|--------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| **Stable** | master | - | `v{ver}` | Blue 🔵 |
| **LTS** | V85-LTS | `.LTS` | `v{ver}-lts` | Orange 🟠 |
| **Canary** | canary | - | `v{ver}-canary` | Yellow 🟡 |
| **Alpha** | alpha | - | `v{ver}-nightly` | Purple 🟣 |

**Jobs**:
1. **release-master** - Stable production releases
2. **release-v85-lts** - Long-term support releases
3. **release-canary** - Pre-release builds
4. **release-alpha** - Bleeding-edge builds

**Documentation**: [Full Release Workflow Documentation →](Workflows/ReleaseWorkflow.md)

---

### [Nightly Workflow](Workflows/NightlyWorkflow.md)
**File**: `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`

Automated nightly builds with intelligent change detection.

**Key Features**:
- ⏰ Scheduled execution (00:00 UTC daily)
- 🔍 Change detection (checks for commits in last 24 hours)
- 💰 Resource efficient (skips build when no changes)
- 📦 Automatic NuGet publishing
- 💬 Discord integration
- 🔧 Manual triggering support

**Triggers**:
- Scheduled: Daily at midnight UTC (`0 0 * * *`)
- Manual: workflow_dispatch

**Workflow Behavior**:
- **With Changes**: Builds, packs, publishes to NuGet, sends Discord notification
- **No Changes**: Skips all build steps, completes in ~2 minutes

**Target Branch**: alpha

**Documentation**: [Full Nightly Workflow Documentation →](Workflows/NightlyWorkflow.md)

## Getting Started

### For Contributors

**First Time Setup**:
1. Read [Build Workflow](Workflows/BuildWorkflow.md) to understand CI/CD process
2. Review [Release Workflow](Workflows/ReleaseWorkflow.md) for release channels
3. Familiarize yourself with [Nightly Workflow](Workflows/NightlyWorkflow.md) for daily builds

**Common Tasks**:
- **Submit a Pull Request**: See [Build Workflow Usage Examples](BuildWorkflow.md#usage-examples)
- **Create a Release**: See [Release Workflow Usage Examples](ReleaseWorkflow.md#usage-examples)

### For Maintainers

**Workflow Management**:

| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_NIGHTLY` | Nightly, Release (alpha) | Nightly release announcements |

**Documentation**: See individual workflow docs for detailed secret configuration.

### Build Scripts

| Script | Used By | Configuration | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------|

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Likely Workflow | Solution Link |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| PR build fails | Build | [Build Troubleshooting](Workflows/BuildWorkflow.md#troubleshooting) |
| NuGet push fails | Any release | [Release Troubleshooting](Workflows/ReleaseWorkflow.md#troubleshooting) |
| Discord notification not sent | Release/Nightly | [Nightly Troubleshooting](Workflows/NightlyWorkflow.md#troubleshooting) |
| GitHub release creation fails | Build | [Build Troubleshooting](Workflows/BuildWorkflow.md#troubleshooting) |
| Nightly build always skipped | Nightly | [Nightly Troubleshooting](Workflows/NightlyWorkflow.md#troubleshooting) |

### Common Issues Across Workflows

#### Multi-Targeting Build Failures
**Symptom**: `error NETSDK1045: The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET X.X`

**Solution**:
1. Check SDK setup steps in workflow logs
2. Verify `continue-on-error` is set for optional SDKs
3. Review global.json generation logic

#### NuGet Package Already Exists
**Symptom**: `Package already exists - skipped`

**Expected**: This is normal; increment version to publish new package

#### Workflow Not Triggering
**Symptom**: Workflow doesn't run at expected time

**Common Causes**:
- Workflow file not on correct branch
- GitHub Actions disabled in settings
- Branch protection preventing push
- Cron schedule timezone confusion

## Best Practices

### Workflow Development

1. **Document Changes**: Update workflow docs when modifying workflows
2. **Version Control**: Commit workflow changes with clear messages
3. **Review Logs**: Always review workflow logs after changes
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track workflow duration and optimize

### Release Management

1. **Version Discipline**: Increment versions consistently
2. **Test Releases**: Validate in canary before stable
3. **Communicate**: Announce releases to users
4. **Monitor**: Watch for issues after releases
5. **Document**: Update changelog with releases

### Security

1. **Rotate Secrets**: NuGet API keys every 90-180 days
2. **Minimum Permissions**: Use narrowest scopes
3. **Monitor Activity**: Watch for unauthorized publishes
4. **Enable 2FA**: On NuGet and GitHub accounts
5. **Never Commit**: Keep secrets out of version control

### Maintenance

1. **Quarterly SDK Updates**: Update .NET versions
2. **Action Version Updates**: Keep GitHub Actions up to date
3. **Regular Reviews**: Review workflow performance monthly
4. **Clean Up**: Remove old test packages from NuGet
5. **Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with workflows
