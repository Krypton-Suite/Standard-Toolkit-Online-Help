# Using SLNX in Visual Studio

Starting with version 100, **all** Krypton source code supports Visual Studio's `slnx` file formats. The question you might be asking yourself is why the change? There is a very simple answer... simplicity!

For 20+ years, the default format has been `sln`. The issue is that the file structure is incredibly messy to deal with.

With the new `slnx` file format, it's entirely XML based, which means it is more maintainable.
