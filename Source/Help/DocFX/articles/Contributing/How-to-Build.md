# How to Build the Standard Toolkit

If you want to build the Standard Toolkit project, there are a number of prerequisites you will need to have first before continuing.

* A supported copy of Windows 10/11
* Microsoft Visual Studio/Build Tools 2022 or later
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later
* .NET 6 or later
* Windows Terminal (optional)
* Ensure that [Long path name support](Allowing-for-Longer-Path-and-File-Names.md) is enabled
* Time :slightly_smiling_face:

To compile the source tree for yourself, type in `run.cmd` from Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. By running `run.cmd`, you will also generate the NuGet packages. The output will be stored in 'Bin\Release'.
