# How to install .NET SDK Preview versions

Each year, Microsoft announces a new version of the .NET SDK, which is usually generally available in November. Typically the first preview version is announced in the February Patch Tuesday updates. The latest version is .NET 11.

There are two ways of installing the .NET SDK Preview versions. Either via the .NET [downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet), or via WinGet:

```ps
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.Preview
```
